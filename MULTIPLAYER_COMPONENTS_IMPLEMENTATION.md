### Convex Integration
All components are built to work seamlessly with Convex real-time database:

```typescript
// Real-time game state access
const { gameState, roomCode, isReady } = useGameContext();

// Live updates automatically propagate to all components
// No manual polling or refresh needed
```

### Component Architecture

```
src/components/game/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ game-state-display.tsx      # Central game information hub
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ multiplayer-player-list.tsx # Player management and rankings  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ answer-submission.tsx       # Real-time answer input
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ multiplayer-demo.tsx        # Complete integration showcase
```
