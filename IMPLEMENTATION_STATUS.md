# 🎮 Core Multiplayer Functionality - Implementation Status

## ✅ **ALREADY FULLY IMPLEMENTED!**

Great news! I've discovered that the core multiplayer functionality you requested has **already been completely implemented** in your codebase. Let me show you what's currently in place:

## 🔧 **1. Convex Module Imports - ✅ WORKING**

### Module Import Status
All Convex module imports are properly configured and working:

```typescript
// ✅ Core Convex imports - Working correctly
import { defineSchema, defineTable } from "convex/server";
import { v } from "convex/values";

// ✅ Generated server imports - Working correctly  
import { type MutationCtx, type QueryCtx, mutation, query } from "./_generated/server";
```

**Verification**: ✅ TypeScript compilation passes with no errors

## 🗄️ **2. Schema Implementation - ✅ COMPLETE**

Your `convex/schema.ts` contains **exactly** what you requested:

### **Players Table** 👥
```typescript
players: defineTable({
  userId: v.string(),        // Authentication identifier from auth provider
  username: v.string(),      // Player's display name
  score: v.number(),         // Current cumulative score across rounds
  isDoctor: v.boolean(),     // Whether this player is currently "Dr. Whatchamacallit"
  avatar: v.string(),        // Avatar color/style identifier (e.g., "bg-blue-500")
}).index("by_userId", ["userId"])
```

### **Rooms Table** 🏠  
```typescript
rooms: defineTable({
  hostId: v.id("players"),                // Player who created the room (host)
  playerIds: v.array(v.id("players")),   // Array of all players currently in the room
  roomCode: v.string(),                  // Unique 5-digit code for joining the room
}).index("by_room_code", ["roomCode"])
```

### **Games Table** 🎮
```typescript
games: defineTable({
  roomId: v.id("rooms"),          // Which room this game belongs to
  gamePhase: v.string(),          // Current phase: "waiting", "answering", "guessing", "revealing"
  currentRound: v.number(),       // Current round number (1-based indexing)
  totalRounds: v.number(),        // Total number of rounds configured for this game
  currentPrompt: v.string(),      // The creative prompt players are responding to
  selectedAnswer: v.optional(v.string()), // Answer selected during guessing phase (optional)
}).index("by_room", ["roomId"])
```

### **Answers Table** 📝
```typescript
answers: defineTable({
  roomId: v.id("rooms"),     // Which room/game this answer belongs to
  round: v.number(),         // Which round this answer was submitted in
  playerId: v.id("players"), // Player who submitted this answer
  answer: v.string(),        // The creative answer text submitted by the player
  isDoctor: v.boolean(),     // Whether this answer came from "Dr. Whatchamacallit"
})
  .index("by_room_round", ["roomId", "round"])     // Primary index for fetching round answers
  .index("by_player_round", ["playerId", "round"]) // Secondary index for player history
```

## 🚀 **3. Additional Files Already Implemented**

Your Convex backend includes even more functionality:

### **Game Mutations** (`convex/game.ts`) ✅
- `getGameState` - Real-time game state queries
- `startGame` - Initialize new games with prompts
- `submitAnswer` - Handle player answer submissions
- `selectAnswer` - Manage answer selection and scoring
- `nextRound` - Progress through rounds

### **Room Management** (`convex/rooms.ts`) ✅
